</ul>
<h3>English-level</h3>
<p>I can read English well, I had to read a lot of scientific articles in the field of medicine from foreign sources. But I speak and perceive speech by ear much worse. On the Skyeng platform, my level of English was B1, but I think it is more likely to be A2. Now I am in the process of learning the language. In my plans to own it at the B2 level by the time of communication with the mentor.

<h2>Experience</h2> 
<p>I have very little experience in programming, Iâ€™m study using learnJS, as well as using YouTube and Google. I started studying 5 months ago, during this time I learned pixel layout and the basics of js, how to work with the DOM tree, the principle of DOM-events, I know how to use arrays and objects. Most likely, all these skills are still at the initial level, I will be glad to learn more while studying at this school.
</p>
<p>I have a lot of ideas for projects in my head, so I want to fully master JS and React first. This will allow me to implement many of my ideas and, of course, will come in handy when working for the company.
