## About myself

Beginner programmer, finishing medic.

## Education

### Education before I fell in love with programming:

1. Secondary completed education (11th grade).
2. Incomplete higher education (currently at the stage of completion, course 5/6):
		1. Institute: medical
		2. Specialty: medical care

### Programming education:

1. HTML-Academy
2. Code-Camp
3. Self-study

## Experience
I have very little experience in programming, Iâ€™m study using learnJS, as well as using YouTube and Google. I started studying 5 months ago, during this time I learned pixel layout and the basics of js, how to work with the DOM tree, the principle of DOM-events, I know how to use arrays and objects. Most likely, all these skills are still at the initial level, I will be glad to learn more while studying at this school.

I have a lot of ideas for projects in my head, so I want to fully master JS and React first. This will allow me to implement many of my ideas and, of course, will come in handy when working for the company.
